# Simple Django file upload and public download demo
#
# This project allows an admin user to upload files through the Django admin
# interface, and exposes a home page where anyone can view and download
# uploaded files.
#
# Quick start:
# 1. Create a virtualenv: `python -m venv env`
# 2. Activate it (Windows): `env\Scripts\activate` or (mac/linux) `source env/bin/activate`
# 3. Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
# 4. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
# 5. Create superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
# 6. Run server: `python manage.py runserver`
# 7. Visit admin at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to upload files
# 8. Visit home at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to view and download files
